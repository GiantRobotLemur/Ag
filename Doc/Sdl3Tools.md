# Sdl3Tools - An SDL3 C++ wrapper library
---
This library provides a C++ wrapper for the new version of the SDL library.
The library provides classes which manage finite SDL resources such as Windows
Surfaces and GPU elements. A lot of work has been put into wrapping the GPU
framework which is new to version 3 of the SDL library.
